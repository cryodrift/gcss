this is a css framework written by @chrisgab 2025

it mostly maps css rules to classnames

it has its own reset

it has some color vars

classes are prefixed with g- for all screens or gl- for large screens or gs- for small screens

classnames start with firstletter abbr. of padding, margin, width, display, text, border, ...

it uses negativ classes which means g-b makes a border adding g-bb removes the bottom border.
